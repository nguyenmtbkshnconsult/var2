                        <p>Many believe that lullabies, characterized by their less steady beat, contain some acoustic
                            features that are universally calming to infants. In a study, Constance M. Bainbridge and
                            colleagues played both a lullaby sung in the Western Nahuatl language and a non-lullaby sung
                            in the Serbian language to a group of infants. The researchers also measured the infants’
                            heart rates, as a reduced heart rate is considered a measure of relaxation. They claim that
                            the lullaby did indeed relax the infants.</p>

                            a lullaby sung in the Border Kuna language and a non-lullaby sung in the Scottish Gaelic

                            the songs played.

                            <p>In the aquatic kingdom, three species of fish exhibit distinct head and mouth morphology:
                                the
                                Broadface <em>Chromis latus</em>, the Mediumface <em>Chromis mediocris</em>, and the
                                Narrowface <em>Chromis angustus</em>. Historically, it has been observed that under low
                                visibility conditions in water the Narrowface <em>Chromis</em> exhibits the highest
                                sensitivity to changes in water pressure, indicating a high ability to sense waves and
                                pressure changes. It is followed by the Mediumface <em>Chromis</em> and then the
                                Broadface
                                <em>Chromis</em>. A scientist hypothesized that in vortex conditions where rapid water
                                movement significantly affects all fish’s visual capabilities, the fish with a stronger
                                ability to sense water waves and pressure can better evade obstacles in the water than

                                fish, effortlessly avoiding obstructions. To test this hypothesis, researchers placed

                                success rate at which each species avoided the obstacles.

                            <p style="padding-left:1em;">The poet Audre Lorde once claimed that poetry is the most
                                inexpensive of art forms to practice. While people who pursue other art forms—sculpture,
                                architecture, long-form prose—require large blocks of uninterrupted time as well as
                                money to
                                complete their work, poets can write, as Lorde said, "between shifts, in the hospital
                                pantry, on the subway, and on scraps of surplus paper." So poets can make worthwhile art
                                even if they must earn their living in another way.</p>

                                the professionalization of the field. While it is possible in theory for anyone to

                                in <em>Virginia Quarterly Review</em>, <em>Kenyon Review</em>, or a similar major poetry
                                outlet, many people who do so have professional training in poetry and extensive
                                practice
                                writing it, which requires time not often available to those who must also work

                                    in the Sky</em>, is highly regarded despite his mediocre writing style. His prose is
                                workmanlike; <u>his characters are flat and discuss ideas rather than emotions</u>. That
                                his
                                work is enjoyable despite this is a testament to his prodigious imagination—even if

                                read his books only for the ideas, they will have plenty to consider.</p>

                            <p style="padding-left:1em;">Asimov is critiqued for his style, but it is wrong to fault a
                                writer for failing to do what he never intended to do. For example, although most of his
                                novel <em>Foundation</em> consists of people discussing science and politics and we find
                                out
                                little about his characters’ lives, Asimov wanted to convey the vast sweep of human
                                history
                                over centuries, and one of his points is that at such a timescale, individuals don’t
                                matter.
                                Thus his lack of characterization is central to his thematic aims.</p>

                                novel
                                <em>The Enchanted April</em>. Mrs. Wilkins is traveling with a group of acquaintances
                                that

                                she is in charge of the group.

                                with shyness—she was very serene; she could control her conversation; she did not have,
                                horrified, to listen to herself saying things she had no idea of saying when she began;
                                she
                                was quite at her ease, and completely natural.</p>

                            <p>In 2011 Stephen D. Simpson and colleagues published a study concluding that ocean
                                acidification has a strong effect on the behavior of <em>Amphiprion percula</em>, a
                                species
                                of fish. However, Simpson and colleagues’ study relied on a mean sample size of only
                                about
                                26 fish. In a 2022 review of various scientists’ conclusions about the impacts of ocean
                                acidification on fish behavior, Jeff C. Clements and colleagues caution that relying on

                                a relatively small sample size can increase the potential for biased analysis. Such

                            <p>Optimal foraging theory (OFT) holds that animals’ foraging behaviors reflect cost-benefit
                                trade-offs that vary by species and with dynamic ecological circumstances. One such
                                circumstance is lunar intensity, which Alexander Lang and colleagues found to be
                                negatively
                                associated with foraging by white throated round-eared bats but Patricia C. Wright found
                                to
                                be positively associated with foraging by three-striped night monkeys. This discrepancy
                                is
                                explicable in terms of OFT: the monkeys’ greater reliance on vision means that higher
                                lunar
                                intensity benefits them more than it benefits the bats.</p>

                            <p style="padding-left:1em;">In separate studies, Stephen Meding and Robert J. Zasoski and
                                Xinhua He and colleagues examined whether plants transfer nutrients to one another using
                                a
                                common mycorrhizal network (CMN)—a lattice of fungal strands in the soil. Meding and

                                excluded all pathways other than the CMN by using barriers to keep the plants’ root

                            <p>The following text is from Anthony Trollope’s 1855 novel
                                <em>The
                                    Warden</em>. Charles James is the son of a high-ranking clergy member.</p>
                            <p style="padding-left:1em;">Charles James was an exact and careful boy; he never committed himself; he well knew how
                                much
                                was expected from the eldest son of the Archdeacon of Barchester, and was therefore
                                mindful
                                not to mix too freely with other boys. He had not the great talents of his younger
                                brothers,
                                but he exceeded them in judgment and propriety of demeanour; his fault, if he had one,
                                was
                                an over-attention to words instead of things; there was a thought too much finesse about
                                him, and, as even his father sometimes told him, he was too fond of a compromise.</p>

                                in 2017, whereas Cameroon, which shows the opposite pattern on such indices, had an
                                inflation rate of only 0.64% that year. Such a comparison may seem consistent with the
                                theoretical critique that by diluting control over the economy, democratic institutions
                                inhibit states’ ability to counteract inflationary pressures, but when Raj Desai et al.
                                examined democratic strength, intranational inequality, and inflation in more than 100
                                countries, they found that democratic strength, if associated with low inequality,
                                restrains
                                inflationary pressures, which would suggest that __________.</p>

                            inflation rate is primarily but not exclusively attributable to the different levels of
